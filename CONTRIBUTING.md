First, thank you so much for trying to contribute!

Typically, there would be Contributing Guidelines here. But I'm not going to make you read something long that if you are donating something.

This is a simple project with simple goals:

1. Implement Zoom APIs for Laravel (and maybe broader PHP) applications
2. Maybe offer simplified versions of those Zoom APIs where that makes sense

If your contributions is relevant to either of the goals, thank you for contributing, I really appreciate it.
