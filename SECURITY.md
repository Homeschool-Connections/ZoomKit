# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The final version of ZoomKit has not been released yet, so there is currently
no support or guarantee that the API will remain stable (as much as I will try
to keep things mostly identical). Once v1.0 is released, Semantic Versioning
will kick in and breaking changes will only occur on major-number releases. 

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |
